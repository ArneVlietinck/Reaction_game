This game is developed with the Miosix kernel and made for the discoveryboard S\+T\+M32\+F407G. It is a project for Embedded Systems 1 and Advanced Operating Systems of prof. William Fornaciari at the Politecnico di Milano.\hypertarget{index_Gameplay}{}\section{Gameplay}\label{index_Gameplay}
The game starts when the player pushes on the button. To emphasize the start of the game, the four L\+ED\textquotesingle{}s will blink once. From then on each button push can cause gameover. The blinking ritual will start with the blue L\+ED and goes random clockwise or counterclockwise. The main issue of the game is pushing the button when the L\+ED (blue/green/orange/red) blinks twice. If the player pushes the button correctly the time between the blinks will be shorter and consequentely the game will become more difficult. If the player pushes the button to late or in a wrong situation then the board will play a buzzer sound or a high score sound. After the buzzer/high score sound, the game will start over again with blinking the L\+ED\textquotesingle{}s 3 times.
